"Mushrooms in Japanese Verse" - haiku collected by R.H. Blyth. Various dates. Some go back to the 17th Century.

    Coming down the mountain              Hatsutake no
    Through the drizzle                   kaori n furidasu
    To the scent of the first mushrooms   kosame kana
    -Chigetsu


    Mushroom hunting                      Nigemo
    They don't run away                   senu no wo awate
    But everyone is in such a hurry!      kinoko-gari


    Pretending                            Kai kinoko
    The mushrooms bought                  totta furi shite
    Had been gathered                     modori keri           
    -Issa


    It would be nice to make              Enmao
    The lord's retainer                   warai kinoko wo
    Eat Laughing Mushroom                 chito maire           
    -Issa  (Gymnopilus spectabilis, Laughing Jim)

  
    Taking hold with the hand             Ureshisa no
    Of the happiness of the mountain      yama wo Tsukamu ya
    Mushroom gathering!                   raisha Kinokogari     
    -Raisha

    Mushroom gathering                    Takegari ya
    Only the crescent Moon                mikazuki hitotsu
    Left unplucked                        sanrei Torinokoshi    
    -Sanrei

  
    The oak tree falls on them            Hahaso ochite
    and the scent rises                   matsutake mienu
    of unseen Matsutake                   gyoji Nioi kana       
    -Gyoji

    I forgot falling off the horse        Ureshisa ni
    With the happiness                    rakuba wasururu
    Of finding mushrooms                  ukei Kinoko kana
    -Ukei

    Matsutake;                            Matsutake ya
    Taken by someone else                 hito ni toraruru
    Right in front of my nose             kyorai Hana no saki
    -Kyorai

    Mushroom gathering:                   Takegari ya
    Today let's go on until we fall over  kyo wa ki no ne ni
    The roots of the trees                kaso Korobu made      
    -Kaso

    Matsutake                             Matsutake ya 
    From the depths of the pine forest    matsu yori oku no
    The voice of the hawk                 taka no koe         
    -Koya

    Mushroom gathering;                   Takegari ya
    From greediness                       yoku kara michi ni
    We lost our way                       fumimayoi             
    -Jiraku

    Before my hand                        Te no mae ni
    Stretched out for the mushroom        cho no ikizuku
    A butterfly breathing                 kinoko kana           
    -Issa

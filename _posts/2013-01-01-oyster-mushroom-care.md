Oyster Mushroom Bag Care and Fruiting Instructions:

    1. Place your bag in a dark place. A closet is great.
    
    2. Wait 1-3 weeks for your bag to be colonized with white mycelium. 
       You may begin to see pinheads forming. 
       These are baby mushrooms. It is now time to start the fruiting stage!
    
    3. Take your bag out of the closet and put it where it can receive light. 
       The kitchen counter is a good spot.
    
    4. Mist bag at least 2 times a day with water. When mushrooms are larger
       avoid spraying them directly.
    
    5. (optional)To promote growth and prevent the mushrooms from drying out, 
       you can create a more humid environment for your mushrooms
       by building a tent around your mushroom bag using a few BBQ skewers 
       as a frame and covering it with a plastic bag. You can utilize the 
       tent through the whole life of the mushroom bag. Just make sure 
       when the mushrooms start popping to let them breath oxygen a few 
       hours a day by folding back the plastic tent.
    
    6. Harvesting the mushrooms is best when the caps are still rolled under. 
       Enjoy!!

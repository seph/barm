        <i>Mushrooms in Japanese Verse</i>, haiku collected by R.H. Blyth. Various dates. Some go back to the 17th Century.
        <pre>  Coming down the mountain              Hatsutake no
Through the drizzle                   kaori n furidasu
To the scent of the first mushrooms   kosame kana           Chigetsu

Mushroom hunting                      Nigemo
They don't run away                   senu no wo awate
But everyone is in such a hurry!      kinoko-gari

Pretending                            Kai kinoko
The mushrooms bought                  totta furi shite
Had been gathered                     modori keri           Issa

It would be nice to make              Enmao
The lord's retainer                   warai kinoko wo
Eat Laughing Mushroom                 chito maire           Issa  (Gymnopilus spectabilis, Laughing Jim)

Taking hold with the hand             Ureshisa no
Of the happiness of the mountain      yama wo Tsukamu ya
Mushroom gathering!                   raisha Kinokogari     Raisha

Mushroom gathering                    Takegari ya
Only the crescent Moon                mikazuki hitotsu
Left unplucked                        sanrei Torinokoshi    Sanrei

The oak tree falls on them            Hahaso ochite
and the scent rises                   matsutake mienu
of unseen Matsutake                   gyoji Nioi kana       Gyoji

I forgot falling off the horse        Ureshisa ni
With the happiness                    rakuba wasururu
Of finding mushrooms                  ukei Kinoko kana      Ukei

Matsutake;                            Matsutake ya
Taken by someone else                 hito ni toraruru
Right in front of my nose             kyorai Hana no saki   Kyorai

Mushroom gathering:                   Takegari ya
Today let's go on until we fall over  kyo wa ki no ne ni
The roots of the trees                kaso Korobu made      Kaso

Matsutake                             Matsutake ya 
From the depths of the pine forest    matsu yori oku no
The voice of the hawk                 taka no koe           Koya

Mushroom gathering;                   Takegari ya
From greediness                       yoku kara michi ni
We lost our way                       fumimayoi             Jiraku

Before my hand                        Te no mae ni
Stretched out for the mushroom        cho no ikizuku
A butterfly breathing                 kinoko kana           Issa

            <pre style="font-size: small"><b>Oyster Mushroom Bag Care and Fruiting Instructions:</b>
1. Place your bag in a dark place. A closet is great.
2. Wait 1-3 weeks for your bag to be colonized with white mycelium. You may begin to see pinheads forming.
 These are baby mushrooms. It is now time to start the fruiting stage!
3. Take your bag out of the closet and put it where it can receive light. The kitchen counter is a good spot.
4. Mist bag at least 2 times a day with water. When mushrooms are larger avoid spraying them directly.
5. (optional)To promote growth and prevent the mushrooms from drying out, you can create a more humid environment for your mushrooms
 by building a tent around your mushroom bag using a few BBQ skewers as a frame and covering it with a plastic bag.
 You can utilize the tent through the whole life of the mushroom bag. Just make sure when the mushrooms start popping
 to let them breath oxygen a few hours a day by folding back the plastic tent.
6. Harvesting the mushrooms is best when the caps are still rolled under. Enjoy!!
